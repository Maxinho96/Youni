# Youni

Youni is an app for Roma Tre University students. They can sign in with their personal accounts and see useful resources for their classes.
A user can search classes of a faculty and add them to his favourites. At any time he can remove a class if no longer interested in it.
Every class has a dedicated page, where the student can see a list of resources and open them and every resource has a visualizations indicator. There is also a search bar to easily find resources.
The user can modify his personal data through his profile page.
